                    <h2>What's going on?</h2>
                    <p>Working with Emily, we are writing funcitons that take our input.
                    </p>

                     <h3>Challenges</h3>
                     <p>I had challenges figureing out how to input what I was needing.I was 
                    slightly confused on what I was suppose to actually obtain.Along with how
                    to actually have everything on my page.
                     </p>

                     <h4>Results</h4>
                     <p> I was able to create what was shown here. I was also able to create 
                     this imput and have all my functions visible.
