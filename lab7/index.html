            <h1>Lab 7:Functions</h1>
            <p>Working with Emily, we are writing funcitons that take our input.</p>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>I had challenges figureing out how to input what I was needing.I was 
            slightly confused on what I was suppose to actually obtain.Along with how
            to actually have everything on my page.</p>
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p> I was able to create what was shown here. I was also able to create 
            this imput and have all my functions visible.</p>
