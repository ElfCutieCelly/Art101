            <h1> Lab 9: Libraries & jQuery/h1>
            <p>Working with my partner, we experimented with the knowledge and
            understandings of the values and functions of libraries. Along with 
            the use of jQuery in order to become better coders.</p>

            <h2> Challenges</h2>
            <p>Would be of the fact that I have to remenber the order, and process
            of entering the codes.Along with how to actually have the website being
            to funciton correctly.</p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>I was able to have the wesite, work. Why don't you see for yourself!</p>
