            <h1> Lab 9: Libraries & jQuery</h1>
            <p>Working with my partner, we experimented with the knowledge and
            understandings of the values and functions of libraries. Along with 
            the use of jQuery in order to become better coders.</p>

        <div id="challenges" class="minoe-section">
            <h2> Challenges</h2>
            <p>Was getting the functions to work, like how we saw them working in 
            lecture.Along with making sure that everything was functioning properly.
            Also making sure in order for eveyrthing to work, spelling and checking if I did not miss a key step
            was a lot of work.</p>
