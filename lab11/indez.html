                    <p>I was having trouble getting all of the functions to work. I had to double check and make sure that I had all the proper stuff linked
                    and had to make sure that I was able to have different names being inputed and making sure that all is working. I had to make sure spelling
                    was on point and that all was well. I did have to try and double check the values.
