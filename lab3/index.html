		<h1>Lab 3 File Stuctures</h1>
		<p>The idea of this lab was to furth create a loack file 
		stucture on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> It was easy creating the file stucture once I go the hang 
		of it, but I had soem ddifficulty creating index.html files and 
		making them work right.</p>
		<h2> Reuslts</h2>
		<p> Well you are looking at the index.html file I created. Here
		is the file structure that I made:</p>
		<img src="../lab3/img/BETTER.png" width=650>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="../index.html">Back to Homepage</a></li>
		</ul>
