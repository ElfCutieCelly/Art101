                    <p>For this lab, my partner are wworking to debug our pervious codes and more to show our true understanding what it means to code.</p>

                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>I was having touble seeing what I was missing and what I was not understading. I 
                    was also not in the right mental space at the time, so everything was just seeming to be to 
                    much. I was also facing problem with having to focus on my other coding for finals that are 
                    soon to be here and... over all my living situation. Sorry this was about coding, I would also
                    say I had trouble remmbering certain comands to help me fix my problems. 
                    </p>

                <div id="results">
                    <div class="minor-section">
                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p> I was able to fix all my labs again. I mean look how I was able to have all my sections have a baorder 
                    and have them all in peace. I am so proud, after all the stress I went under I 
                    really am glad everything is working.
