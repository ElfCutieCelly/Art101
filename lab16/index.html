                    <p>For this lab,my partner and I are now applying JSON and APIs onto this html. To 
                    show our basic understanding of what we where tought during lecture.

                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>I was so confused, and I was watching the lecture, to actually have an undrestandin 
                    of how to actually apply JSON and APIs and have them actually functioning on the html. 
                    I have also been lakcing sleep thanks to my animation but that's not the point. I would
                    say linking and coding over all was a problem.

                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p> I mean it works, look at what this is showing you. I mean it looks like I know what 
                    the heck I am doing.
