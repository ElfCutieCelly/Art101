                <p> For this lab, my partner and I are now applying JSON and APIs onto this html. 
                To show our basic understanding of what we were tought during lecture.

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p> I was so confused, and I was watching the lecture, to actually have an understanding
                of how to actually apply JSON and APIs and have them actually functioning on the html. I 
                also been lacking sleep thanks to my animation but that's not the point. I would also say
                that linking and coding ovetall was a problem.

                <p>  I mean it works, look at what this is showing you. I mean it looks like I know 
                what the heck am doing.
