                    <p>For this lab, my partner and I will be using what we learned about AJAX during lecture, and apply that to our lab.</p>

                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>I not only was unable to find a partner who was willing to respond and help me. I was also un able to fully righta away 
                    remeber what it was that I needed to do for this assigment, along with having to get AJAX to properly function.I was struggling 
                    to apply all the needed links, as where I had stuggled remenbering how to crate a button. However that was an easy chaallenege to 
                    overcome. I just was struggling to remember how to get AJAX to poroperly functon.
