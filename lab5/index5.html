        <h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
        <p> Working with Jesus, we are experimenting with basic
        javaScript data types and variables.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>I had to learn the new command of document.write() to
        work. I also had to repeat words I typed.</p>
        <h3>Resuts</h3>
        <p> Looking at this html, I have created this page that I 
        present to you. In hopes that I understand coding. I feel 
        acomplished.</p>
