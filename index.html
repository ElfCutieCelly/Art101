					<h2>About Me</h2>

					I am a first year student at UC Santa Cruz,as an Art major and Education 
					Minor. My goals in the future is to be a highschool teacehr, with a small 
					art business shop, selling merchandise of fandoms and my personal original 
					charachers.I am the oldest out out 6 children. I have one younger brother 
					and four younger sisters. I love my parents and my siblings. I do no have 
					the perfect life, but I do love it none the less. My hopes and dreams are 
					to teach younge minds, about the ways of art. In hopes along the way that I
					can be a shoulder for them to lean on, as the teachers in my highschool where
					for me. If you would like to know more than just the serious bits, keep reading 
					down below. In where I will share my art and personal intrest of my own.</p>

					<h3>Hobbies</h3>
					<p>I am a girl of many intrest, I know that seems basic but its the truth.
					Hobbies of Mine consist art, reading, sports, collecting and yelling. I love 
					yelling at the top of my lungs. It is just a hobbie I do when I can't contain my emotions
					within myself. As for art, I love doing mixed meida art. I love painting, drawing,
					working with clay, and etc. I can not say I do not have a least favorite form of
					art just yet. There is still so much art I need to learn and explore. I love playing 
					volleyball, it is by far the best sport in my opinion. I played in in my highschool years
					and I loved it. It has been a sport I loved ever since I was in 5th grade. Now reading, 
					please I can go on about books and the amount of love I have for them. I love to read romance,
					fantasy and so much more. I have not explored all of the genres of books. My books are 
					one of my prized collections. I love getting the satisfaction of finishing a book series.
					My favorite authors consit of Lauren Asher, Ana Huang, and Sarah J Mass. They have given me 
					the best reading experience in reading. As for collecting, I love collecting all sort of 
					stuffed animals, plushies, Hello Kitty and Friends,books, and my all time growing collections
					to this day...squishmallows. I. Love.Squishmallos. I take pride in my little army of stuffed animals.
					What can I say, I am a crazy hopless romantice, stuffed animal, book consuming girl.</p>
