                        <h2> Challenge</h2>
                        <p> For this lab, my partner and I are using DOM manipulation to generate randome
                        fake dialogue in the format of a text conversation.</p>

                        <h2>Problems Faced</h2>
                        <p>I waz facing many troubles in debuging my web page. I honeslty was having trouble
                        with the buttons again. It is difficult to remeber some of the key functions and key 
                        information that is needed for coding, in order for the code ot woek. I was also very 
                        nervous that I was missing something or miss-spelling words. Because those are key when
                        needing a the code to work.</p>

                        <p> I was also bery busy with other class work that needed my much needed attention due
                        to the strike being finalized and authorized. So I was making sure that my assignments 
                        where submitted, and that I was still on a good spot to pass.</p>

                        <h2> Results</h2>
                        <p> Here are the results, go on give it a try. Click the button... it wont hurt you
                        I think...</p>
