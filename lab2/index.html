			<h1>Hello World</h1>

			<p>My partner name is Manuel Marshutz and I transferred to UCSC as a junior. I have declared Art as my 
				major and I am starting to work on declaring Technology & Information Management as my second major. 
				I have taken an HTML course prior to this class at San Mateo Community College where I touched up on HTML and CSS styling. 
				However, I have zero experience with the functionality aspect of web development so javascript will be entirely new to me. 
				Anyways, I have three cats that I may upload and showcase, I just finished a Pirates of the Caribbean marathon 
				(except the last which I was told wasn't worth watching), and I play an immense amount of Tarkov.</p>
